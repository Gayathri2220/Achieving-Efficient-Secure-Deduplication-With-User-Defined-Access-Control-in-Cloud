# Achieving-Efficient-Secure-Deduplication-With-User-Defined-Access-Control-in-Cloud
Cloud Service Provider (CSP): The CSP provides storage services for user. In the authorized deduplication system, without violating access control, the CSP would like to eliminate the redundant data and keep only one copy to reduce the overhead associated with data storage...
# Which is an efficient technique for cloud storage using secured de duplication algorithm?
Tag consistency: After data deduplication, only one copy is stored in the CSP, and if this copy is inconsistent with the related tag, i.e., a malicious user (corrupted by an adversary) launches duplicate faking attacks during data upload, then the subsequent data owner together with authorized users cannot obtain the...
# What is cloud deduplication techniques?
The framework for the secured de-duplication system functions for scaling down the number of repeated copies or files. It performs a comparison for two documents using cosine similarity. It further uses NLTK algorithms for checking and detecting the meanings of both the files...
# What is secure deduplication?
Deduplication eliminates these extra copies which are the same, just to save a copy of the data. Data privacy, security, confidentiality and integrity are few main concerns of storing data on cloud and to address these concerns, Convergent Encryption is used along with deduplication technique...
# What is the algorithm used in deduplication?
Dedup Algorithms - Using a Flow Control to Remove Duplicates for a Document Cache. Summary: A flow control that runs a single document at a time before a cache with a decision shape to check if a document with a similiar index key is in the cache. Advantage: This method is easy to understand and design...
# How the deduplication role improves the storage efficiency of the storage infrastructure?
Data deduplication is a vital technique that significantly enhances storage efficiency by eliminating redundant copies of data. It works by storing only a single copy of data, regardless of how often it appears...
# Which of the following encryption techniques is used for securing cloud?
The two types of cloud encryption are symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Enterprises often use a combination of these two encryption methods to build a more comprehensive approach to cloud security...
# What are the different methods of securing data in cloud?
Authentication
We can do digital authentication using credentials, which is usually a password. Other tools here are captcha, patterns, audio recognition, etc. The aim of these is to ensure that an authorised person gets access to critical information in the cloud...
# What is backup optimization deduplication in cloud computing?
Backup deduplication minimizes storage space by detecting data repetition and storing the identical data only once. Deduplication also reduces network load, because duplicates of data previously backed up is not even transferred over the network to storage...
# What is the purpose of deduplication?
Data deduplication is a process that eliminates excessive copies of data and significantly decreases storage capacity requirements. Deduplication can be run as an inline process as the data is being written into the storage system and/or as a background process to eliminate duplicates after the data is written to disk...
